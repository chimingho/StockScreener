        1 Earnings to price (the inverse of P/E) is double the high-grade corporate bond yield. If the high-grade bond yields 7%, then earnings to price should be 14%.
        2 P/E ratio that is 0.4 times the highest average P/E achieved in the last five years.
        3 Dividend yield is 2/3 the high-grade bond yield. 
        4 Stock price of 2/3 the tangible book value per share. 
        5 Stock price of 2/3 the net current asset value. 
        6 Total debt is lower than tangible book value. 
        7 Current ratio (current assets ÷ current liabilities) is greater than 2. 
        8 Total debt is no more than liquidation value. 
        9 Earnings have doubled in most recent ten years. 
        10 Earnings have declined no more than 5% in 2 of the past 10 years.

        /*
        1 Earnings consistent with cash flow: These two things won’t be equal but should march side by side. If earnings consistently grow faster than cash flow, that’s a bad sign.
        2 Growing current assets other than cash: Watch for increasing inventories or accounts receivable, particularly in proportion to sales.
        3 Straight-line depreciation and amortization, long time periods: Asset recovery may be delayed through deferring depreciation and amortization in order to boost earnings. Understand what practice the company uses,and whether it’s consistent with others in the industry — and common sense.
        4 Understand asset impairments: Note which assets are “impaired” or on the block for possible write-downs, and understand why.
        5 LIFO versus FIFO: LIFO is a more conservative approach to measuring cost of goods sold and inventory levels, as most of the recent (and more expensive) stock is assumed to be consumed first. Note that this may not be true in every industry.
        6 Reserves against bad debts change dramatically: Watch for bad debt and other reserves as a sign of deterioration in current asset quality.
        7 Accounting policies change: Note 1 should be simple and straightforward. Look at revenue and cost recognition. Complex, unexplained changes may spell trouble.
        8. 10-K report is longer than 100 pages: Something complex is going on. Opportunity knocks for accounting fiction and other things that are hard to understand.
        9. Persistent, poorly explained write-offs: If the write-offs are large or repetitive, try to understand why. Big gap between pro forma and GAAP 
        10. Understand why and what the company is trying to tell you by reporting both.
